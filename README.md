1. this is my first experement in order to understand: if i deployed a project on the github pages, so can i edit or scale it in the future or not.✅❌😵
so i am checking it out?

i add a line in the logic.js on the 26th number which is
26. console.log('audio has been played!');
90. console.log(`it's a draw`);
checkit out if it is showing after upadting the git repo and, is it reflecting in the deployed project or not.
